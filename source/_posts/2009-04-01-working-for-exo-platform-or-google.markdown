**Note: This is an April Fool's Day joke**

I'm thinking so much about this. I've got an offer from Google to work in Singapore for about 2
years after my OpenSocial application took the 2nd place in OpenSocial Application contest in SE
Asia. However, I can't touch the Ipod Touch because of customs official issue but I coud get the
money instead :(. Shannon Madison and I have been discussing about it in recent days. She said that
someone from Google will take part in BarCamp Hanoi 2009 and will tell us about some stratergy in
South East Asia in general and in Vietnam for specific. Now I have choose: having part-time job at
eXo Platform or having full-time job from Google to work in Singapore for 2 years.

Working for Google is a very important opportunity for my future. Shannon said to me about the plan
of Google to have representative office in Vietnam soon, so if I aggree to worked with them in
Singapore in 2 years, and then I can come back to work in the representative office of Google in
Hanoi. Well, I know this is the only chance for me to work abroad and work for Google. How
interesting it is! However, if I agree to work in Singapore, it means that I have to discontinue my
study at HUT university; it means that I have to leave my family, my friends and all my good
memories behind to work there. I've never been abroad, I love it.

Another point to mention, I've just been working at eXo Platform for 1,5 months. Everything has just
started, I haven't done good job in eXo. I have tried much to work here. After a short period of
time, I know eXo Platform is the best place in Hanoi for my study, work and friendship. Everyone
here is very nice, we can easily get familar with each other. We share about many things: weeding,
karaokeing, departure parties. I want to know more about eXo Platform, to understand it and apply it
for my last project in Hanoi Aptech.

So if I aggree to work for Google in Singapore, I have to give up so many things here. If not, I'm
still working in eXo Platform as is. Oh my God, how can I choose one? If only after some time
working for eXo Platform, would I get this kind of offer from Google? Could anyone show me the
right way :(?

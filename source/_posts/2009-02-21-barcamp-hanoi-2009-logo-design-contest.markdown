{% img center /images/barcamphanoismall2.png Barcamp Hanoi 1 Logo %}

The current logo you’re seeing on top of this page is the logo of Barcamp Hanoi 1. Several months
ago, right after we put it on the homepage,  some people gave us feedback that we should change the
logo. And we see that other Barcamps also change their logo for each individual event. So we think
it’s right time now to announce a tiny logo design contest for Barcamp Hanoi 2009. Then we can use
the winning logo to print banner, T-shirt, official documents and put it on the homepage. You can
read more detail about the contest below:

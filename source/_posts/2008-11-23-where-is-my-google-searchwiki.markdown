Where is the Google SearchWiki that is a new feature encouraging people to have search more with new
experience? Just 2 days after Google's announcement it's gone. Does it mean that SearchWiki is not
very helpful and Google decided to take it out?

Google says that this is a bug and is working on restoring SearchWiki now: “We’re really sorry that
people can’t use SearchWiki at the moment - we’re working to fix the problem as quickly as we can.
Please bear with us.”

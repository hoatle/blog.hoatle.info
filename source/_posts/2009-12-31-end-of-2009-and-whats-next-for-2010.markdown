Ok, this is the end day of the year 2009 and now from I wanna blog again :d. I have many things to
write and I will try to spend some time for it. It's nearly 8 months since my last blog post, so in
this post, I just wanna remind some of my remarkable time and event.

<!-- more -->

- February: Joined eXo Platform SEA and worked as document writer, then join eXo Social team as
a Java Developer.

- April: Co-organized Barcamp Hanoi 2009 (with @xoai, @forty4vn, @dac2205, @xoai's friend :d). It
was my first time to organize such an event, keeping in touch with interesting persons,
having meet-ups. I talked about "OpenSocial" there.

- November: 3 days talking about "OpenSocial and eXo Platform" with @tuanchip (eXo CS team leader),
Nam (CS team), Thuy (Marketing and Communication department), Viet (HR manager) at 3 FPT-APTECH
centers.

- December:

    + My first time to Sai Gon (Ho Chi Minh city) to attend Barcamp Saigon. Special thanks to
      [@jishanvn](http://twitter.com/jishanvn) :D. I talked about "Advanced JavaScript techniques" there.

    + My second time to attend Hanoi PHP Day, this time I talked about "Advanced JavaScript
      Techniques" as I spent much time for writing javascript code these days.

For the year of 2010, hope that I can join many other interesting events, broaden my knowledge more
when I finish my school day at the end of next January. I'm looking forward to a promising year,
the year of 2010 :d.

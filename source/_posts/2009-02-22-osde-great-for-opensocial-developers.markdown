This afternoon I just hit with this project: OSDE - OpenSocial Developement Environment and loved it
at first sight :). This project is awesome for OpenSocial developers to work on their own
environment. I remembered on the first days of developing app, registered all opensocial containers,
make friends [for test :)] and then test the app. Somehow boring steps and not the pro way of app
development. What if you can not have internet connnection but you still want to test you opensocial
app. OSDE - OpenSocial Developement Environment is our solution. This is a great module for
Eclipse :).

Click on this link and let's create great apps: http://www.eisbahn.jp/trac/osde/

Everything there is good enough to code, much more easier to have your app in development stage :)

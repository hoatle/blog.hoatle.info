At present we are having some logo submitted for the contest and we know that the time seems so
short for you all to complete your logo for submission.

After great 2nd Barcamp Hanoi organizer meetup tonight, the Logo Design Contest submission deadline
is extended to:

`Saturday, March 21st, 11:59 PM (GMT+7)`

So you will have more than 3 weeks from now to prepare. But donâ€™t waste your time, start your work
right now!

Thanks for joining and we are looking for your great Logo for BarCamp Hanoi 2009.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, this is the end day of the year 2009 and now from I wanna blog again :d. I have many things to
write and I will try to spend some time for it. It&rsquo;s nearly 8 months since my last blog post, so in
this post, I just wanna remind some of my remarkable time and event.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li><p>February: Joined eXo Platform SEA and worked as document writer, then join eXo Social team as
a Java Developer.</p></li>
<li><p>April: Co-organized Barcamp Hanoi 2009 (with @xoai, @forty4vn, @dac2205, @xoai&rsquo;s friend :d). It
was my first time to organize such an event, keeping in touch with interesting persons,
having meet-ups. I talked about &ldquo;OpenSocial&rdquo; there.</p></li>
<li><p>November: 3 days talking about &ldquo;OpenSocial and eXo Platform&rdquo; with @tuanchip (eXo CS team leader),
Nam (CS team), Thuy (Marketing and Communication department), Viet (HR manager) at 3 FPT-APTECH
centers.</p></li>
<li><p>December:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>My first time to Sai Gon (Ho Chi Minh city) to attend Barcamp Saigon. Special thanks to
@jishanvn :D. I talked about &ldquo;Advanced JavaScript techniques&rdquo; there.</p></li>
<li><p>My second time to attend Hanoi PHP Day, this time I talked about &ldquo;Advanced JavaScript
Techniques&rdquo; as I spent much time for writing javascript code these days.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>For the year of 2010, hope that I can join many other interesting events, broaden my knowledge more
when I finish my school day at the end of next January. I&rsquo;m looking forward to a promising year,
the year of 2010 :d.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Note: This is an April Fool&rsquo;s Day joke</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m thinking so much about this. I&rsquo;ve got an offer from Google to work in Singapore for about 2
years after my OpenSocial application took the 2nd place in OpenSocial Application contest in SE
Asia. However, I can&rsquo;t touch the Ipod Touch because of customs official issue but I coud get the
money instead :(. Shannon Madison and I have been discussing about it in recent days. She said that
someone from Google will take part in BarCamp Hanoi 2009 and will tell us about some stratergy in
South East Asia in general and in Vietnam for specific. Now I have choose: having part-time job at
eXo Platform or having full-time job from Google to work in Singapore for 2 years.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Working for Google is a very important opportunity for my future. Shannon said to me about the plan
of Google to have representative office in Vietnam soon, so if I aggree to worked with them in
Singapore in 2 years, and then I can come back to work in the representative office of Google in
Hanoi. Well, I know this is the only chance for me to work abroad and work for Google. How
interesting it is! However, if I agree to work in Singapore, it means that I have to discontinue my
study at HUT university; it means that I have to leave my family, my friends and all my good
memories behind to work there. I&rsquo;ve never been abroad, I love it.</p>

<p>Another point to mention, I&rsquo;ve just been working at eXo Platform for 1,5 months. Everything has just
started, I haven&rsquo;t done good job in eXo. I have tried much to work here. After a short period of
time, I know eXo Platform is the best place in Hanoi for my study, work and friendship. Everyone
here is very nice, we can easily get familar with each other. We share about many things: weeding,
karaokeing, departure parties. I want to know more about eXo Platform, to understand it and apply it
for my last project in Hanoi Aptech.</p>

<p>So if I aggree to work for Google in Singapore, I have to give up so many things here. If not, I&rsquo;m
still working in eXo Platform as is. Oh my God, how can I choose one? If only after some time
working for eXo Platform, would I get this kind of offer from Google? Could anyone show me the
right way :(?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I just hit with this project: OSDE &ndash; OpenSocial Developement Environment and loved it
at first sight :). This project is awesome for OpenSocial developers to work on their own
environment. I remembered on the first days of developing app, registered all opensocial containers,
make friends [for test :)] and then test the app. Somehow boring steps and not the pro way of app
development. What if you can not have internet connnection but you still want to test you opensocial
app. OSDE &ndash; OpenSocial Developement Environment is our solution. This is a great module for
Eclipse :).</p>

<p>Click on this link and let&rsquo;s create great apps: <a href="http://www.eisbahn.jp/trac/osde/">http://www.eisbahn.jp/trac/osde/</a></p>

<p>Everything there is good enough to code, much more easier to have your app in development stage :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/barcamphanoismall2.png" title="Barcamp Hanoi 1 Logo" ></p>

<p>The current logo you’re seeing on top of this page is the logo of Barcamp Hanoi 1. Several months
ago, right after we put it on the homepage,  some people gave us feedback that we should change the
logo. And we see that other Barcamps also change their logo for each individual event. So we think
it’s right time now to announce a tiny logo design contest for Barcamp Hanoi 2009. Then we can use
the winning logo to print banner, T-shirt, official documents and put it on the homepage. You can
read more detail about the contest below:</p>

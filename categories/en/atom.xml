    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This afternoon I just hit with this project: OSDE &ndash; OpenSocial Developement Environment and loved it
at first sight :). This project is awesome for OpenSocial developers to work on their own
environment. I remembered on the first days of developing app, registered all opensocial containers,
make friends [for test :)] and then test the app. Somehow boring steps and not the pro way of app
development. What if you can not have internet connnection but you still want to test you opensocial
app. OSDE &ndash; OpenSocial Developement Environment is our solution. This is a great module for
Eclipse :).</p>

<p>Click on this link and let&rsquo;s create great apps: <a href="http://www.eisbahn.jp/trac/osde/">http://www.eisbahn.jp/trac/osde/</a></p>

<p>Everything there is good enough to code, much more easier to have your app in development stage :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="/images/barcamphanoismall2.png" title="Barcamp Hanoi 1 Logo" ></p>

<p>The current logo you’re seeing on top of this page is the logo of Barcamp Hanoi 1. Several months
ago, right after we put it on the homepage,  some people gave us feedback that we should change the
logo. And we see that other Barcamps also change their logo for each individual event. So we think
it’s right time now to announce a tiny logo design contest for Barcamp Hanoi 2009. Then we can use
the winning logo to print banner, T-shirt, official documents and put it on the homepage. You can
read more detail about the contest below:</p>

    <link href="http://blog.hoatle.info/2009/02/20/barcamp-hanoi-2-will-come-soon/"/>
    <updated>2009-02-20T08:11:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.hoatle.info/2009/02/20/barcamp-hanoi-2-will-come-soon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I&rsquo;m a little envious of some HCM city (Saigon) geeks' activities, especially about Barcamp Saigon 1 and their #H3 :(. What about in Hanoi? Just correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but it seem there
hasn&rsquo;t been any such interesting events in Hanoi. Here I just want to mention and introduce Barcamp Hanoi 2. You can just google some keyworks orderly to get info: barcamp to have general ideas about what is barcamp, barcampsaigon to know what Saigon geeks did to complete the task of organizing barcamp saigon 1. Then the last keywork is barcamphanoi to know more about Barcamp Hanoi organization status :). And then I will call for organizers + volunteers + participants + some more other things :)</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Firstly, about Barcamp Hanoi 2. Why 2? Good question :P, do you know that Barcamp Hanoi 1 was first organized in Vietnam, esp. in Hanoi :). Just check this: <a href="http://blog.exoplatform.org/2007/12/28/barcamp-hanoi/">http://blog.exoplatform.org/2007/12/28/barcamp-hanoi/</a> So, Barcamp Hanoi 1 was organized by eXo employees (esp. by jeremi) just in internal eXo Platform SEA employees. And Now we (Hanoi geeks, bloggers, volunteers&hellip;) are organizing Barcamp Hanoi 2.</p>

<p>After the great success of Barcamp Saigon 1, some efforts to organize Barcamp Hanoi 2
started but in slow progress. Sometime it was supposed to happen before Tet holiday, then just some weeks after Tet holiday. But now we&rsquo;re still preparing for it and the progress is very fast. This post is also
for the purpose of preparation for Barcamp Hanoi 2. Please just check out what is happening in
Barcamp Hanoi 2 organization: <a href="http://groups.google.com.vn/group/barcamphanoi?hl=en.">http://groups.google.com.vn/group/barcamphanoi?hl=en.</a>
So here I&rsquo;m calling for organizers for Barcamp Hanoi 2 :). It&rsquo;s open to everyone :). Now the number of organizers can not be counted more than 10 and there are many things to do. Some points just remember: Just join in organizer team when you have passionation + know the spirit of barcamp :). Some volunteers needed for doing other things like food-prepare (don&rsquo;t worry, you do not have to cook any meal :P),
T-shirt design (for designers), sponsorship for persuasive speakers and many other things you can do for Barcamp Hanoi 2.</p>

<p>To participants: Know about barcamp spirit, know about barcamp rules, huh :P. No audience (exept for volunteers), just participants: think about what you will share for Barcamp Hanoi 2 (IT based topic),
and what topics you&rsquo;re interesting. We will have some forms to get info soon. We will make Barcamp Hanoi 2 as great and relaxed as possible. If too many people will go for registering Barcamp Hanoi 2, we will have
to filter out out some people :( because of time + venue + other problems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some expectations:</p>

<ul>
<li>What: call it Barcamp Hanoi 2 ;)</li>
<li>When: April 12 (supposed)</li>
<li>Where: RMIT Hanoi or Genetic BK or other?</li>
<li>Who: any one interested in joining barcamp, participants but not audience :)</li>
<li>How many people there: About 200 geeks. So think about some interesting topics to have your seat at Barcamp Hanoi 2. The seats are limited :)</li>
<li>official tag for Barcamp Hanoi 2: barcamphanoi</li>
<li>official website for Barcamp Hanoi 2 will be updated soon, just check it here <a href="http://barcamphanoi.org">http://barcamphanoi.org</a></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is my first working day at eXo Platform SEA, a nice start working day :). Hey, so long no post from my blog sice Tet holiday, now I will blog more often.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;m the lucky one to have chance working at eXo<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> , I&rsquo;ve never thought about it before knowing and meeting Jeremi<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> since Opensocial Hackathon in Hanoi<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. After the hackathon, Jeremi and I had some discussion, he just introduced me to apply for a position at eXo &ndash; a position where my English learning at HUT and computer learning at HN-Aptech meets, so the best position is document writer. I have some good points of writing English, I will write technical documents for eXo, nice and thank Jeremi so much! Though, this is just the very first step to join eXo. I had English test, interview with 3 guys to check general Java knowledge, openSocial knowledge (Tung) and document writing skill (Cong) and then continue my interview with Brice Revenant<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> &ndash; manager at eXo Platform SEA before our Tet holiday. I had another more test for writing a sample of user guide for comminity management when I was home. Lucky me, everything was nice and today I&rsquo;m very pleased to have my first working day and now blogging about it :).</p>

<p>The unlucky year passed by, last year I lost many things and had so many hardships: I was cheated when helping my friend finding a job, cheated to get address for renting, my motorbike was stolen (I will work hard to buy another by the end of this year), so living in Hanoi is really really dangerous [dangerous in peaceful :))], so I should be more and more and more careful. My bike was stolen at the second term at HUT, too :(. Now the new time for new year: my OpenSocial App took second prize at SE Asia OpenSocial Application contest, however, it is still in developement, hope to release it soon. Got some job offers which is very nice at the time of the world economic meltdown :D. Barcamp Hanoi 2 is being prepared, eXo will be one of the sponsers. I hope that I will have more time to wake everything up, Barcamp Hanoi 2 now seems slow in progress, I&rsquo;m preparing to have a session for Barcamp, too :). Next year will be my next big one after university graduation, more time for work, for meetup :).</p>

<p>Today I had some training to have basic ideas about Portal, how to use and organize it, cool ;). Tomorrow I will have training about WebOS and after that a test will come to check for understanding. Everyone here is nice! I just know some more guys: Tung (eXo Social project leader) and Trong (Portal team leader) from Hackathon, Cong (tester) from the interview, Nga (document writer) and Hang (give me and another guy training) &ndash; today. You can see more staffs here: <a href="http://wiki.exoplatform.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Team.">http://wiki.exoplatform.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Team.</a></p>

<p>Love this busy and promising year :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Problem</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Working with OpenSocial message bundle for localization, sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary to bind dynamic
arguments to the message. For example, we have greeting message like this: <code>Hello {user}</code> in which
user will be replaced by user&rsquo;s name. But currently with OpenSocial api, we can&rsquo;t. We just can get
message bundle by the key without passing any arguments for substitution.</p></li>
<li><p>So this is my approach: using <code>eXo.social.Locale.getMsg(key)</code> the same as <code>prefs.getMsg(key)</code> and
<code>eXo.social.Locale.getMsg(key, [val1, val2,...]);</code> for dynamic arguments binding with message bundle.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create <code>eXo.social.Locale class:</code></li>
</ul>


<p>```javascript

<p>Note: The <code>eXo.social.Locale</code> class uses <code>debug</code>, thanks @cowboy for his excellent JavaScript
log/debug. I love it &lt;3. All my projects and apps use it, you should also use this way of debug/log
instead of alert :).</p>

<p>In the app code above, <code>__MSG_hello_world__</code> will be substituted by server with found message bundle
with key &ldquo;hello_world&rdquo; defined in message bundles files. (in <code>/locale</code> folder).</p>

<p>To test <code>eXo.social.Locale</code> class, we have the <code>app.js</code>:</p>

function run() {</p>

<pre><code>var prefs = new gadgets.Prefs(),
    helloWorld = prefs.getMsg('hello_world');
alert(helloWorld); //"Hello world!" if current language is English
                   //"Chào thế giới!" if current language is Vietnamese

//eXo.social.Locale usage
var Locale = eXo.social.Locale;
var helloMsgEl = document.getElementById('helloMsg'),
    helloMsgArgsEl = document.getElementById('helloMsgArgs');

helloMsgEl.innerHTML = Locale.getMsg('hello_world');
helloMsgArgsEl.innerHTML = Locale.getMsg('hello_user_to_place', ['hoatle', 'Vietnam']);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>gadgets.util.registerOnLoadHandler(run);
```</p>

<p>You can test this sample app from any OpenSocial container. Happy coding :D.</p>

<p>P/S: We can use OpenSocial template for arguments binding with message bundle but it&rsquo;s currently
not fully supported by all containers.</p>

<p>After answering his question, I just want to share my experience when working with JavaScript event
handler. I will show you 4 event registration models for the time beings of its use; the way to use
context and this keyword in function handler. My approach is that the event object will be passed
as 1st parameter to the function handler and this has to refer to the element triggering that event.</p>

<p><strong>1. Inline Event Registration Model</strong></p>

<p>From the first days of JavaScript, there is only one way of registering event handler and nowadays
this approach is still being used. Here we call the primitive approach:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;a href="#" onclick="doSomething();"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></p>

<p>People are so familiar with this event registration model, especially from the days of writing the
first lines of JavaScript code. There is nothing wrong with this kind of model, even it&rsquo;s
convenient, fast, easy to understand and people are still using this way :P. However, when
JavaScript evolves, the event registration approach changes because some problems arise: this
approach does not separate structure (html) and behaviour (JavaScript); this makes code more
complex, not very flexible to edit html. Just imagine when creating dom on the fly and constructing
new html fragment code to insert to html document? This approach does not seem fit well in this case.</p>

<p>Now working with event object and this keyword. We have the event handler function:</p>

<p><code>javascript
function doSomething(evt) {
  alert(arguments[0]); // arguments[0] the same as evt
  alert(this);
}
</code></p>

<p>In this case, when the link element is clicked, the <code>doSomething</code> handler function will be called
and <code>evt</code> will get <code>undefined (null)</code> value and <code>this</code> will refer to <code>window</code> object. This is not my
intention, I want the event has to be event object and this has to refer to the link element. So I
have to modify the code a little bit:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;a href="#" onclick="doSomething(event);"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></p>

<p>With above code, the event object is passed to <code>doSomething</code> handler function. In my assumption,
when link element is clicked, the <code>onclick</code> event is triggered from the browser native code:</p>

<p><code>javascript
//[Native Code]
onclick(event) {
  //event handler is called
  doSomething(event);
}
</code></p>

<p>Remember that we pass <code>event</code> as parameter to <code>doSomething</code> function but not any other name. If we
pass <code>evt</code> for example, the exception occurs:</p>

<p><code>javascript
[Native Code]
onclick(event) {
  //call event handler and pass evt as parameter
  doSomething(evt); //exception occured because evt is undefined (null).
}
</code></p>

<p>Because this is the browser native code, it does not allow to use <code>undefined (null)</code> value there.
However, we can pass any <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code> parameter to any our JavaScript functions as normal,
there is no exception in this case. Note that the above code is tested with chrome and it just
works (?). No exception at all but not the case for IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari. Well, in this case
I don&rsquo;t know if google chrome is good or bad?</p>

<p>By using the event parameter passed to <code>doSomething</code> function, now we can get the event object to
get many useful properties there. For example, event type, cursor location, charCode, etc.,</p>

<p>Now we have to make sure <code>this</code> in <code>doSomething</code> function has to refer to link element, not
<code>window</code> object with the following code:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;a href="#" onclick="doSomething.call(this, event)"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></p>

<p>From the browser native code will trigger the <code>onclick</code> event as follows:</p>

<p><code>javascript
onclick(event) {
  //this is the triggred element
  doSomething.call(this, event);
}
</code></p>

<p>The above inline event registration code now works as my intention. I just explain in details in
this part only.</p>

<p><strong>2. Traditional Event Registration Model</strong></p>

<p>This is the model many developers use to separate structure and behaviour in the html document.
Html contains html only, and in JavaScript traditional event registration model will be used:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;a href="#" id="mylink"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Make sure after the dom is loaded, this code will execute:</p>

<p><code>javascript
var linkEl = document.getElementById('myLink');
linkEl.onclick = function() {
  doSomething();
}
</code></p>

<p>This way of event registration is compatible with all major browsers. In this model, event object
is passed as the only parameter to the handler function and <code>this</code> in the handler function block
refer to linkEl.</p>

<p>Code this way to make sure <code>doSomething</code> function still has access to event object and <code>this</code> refers
to element triggering the event.</p>

<p><code>javascript
linkEl.onclick = function(evt) {
  doSomething.call(this,evt);
}
</code></p>

<p>In case the <code>doSomething</code> function has more than 1 arguments:</p>

<p>```javascript
function doSomething(evt, param1, param2) {
//code implementation
}</p>

<p>linkEl.onclick = function(evt) {
  var param1, param2;
  doSomething.call(this, evt, param1, param2);
  // same as: doSomething.apply(this, [evt, param1, param2]);
}
```</p>

<p>And then we come up with 3rd and 4th event registration model: W3C model and Microsof (IE) model.
By combining these 2 models, we got the solution for event registration compatible with all major
browsers:</p>

<p><strong>3. W3C Event Registration Model</strong></p>

<p>This is the specification of W3C to register event listener (handler). By using it, we can register
as many listeners as possible.</p>

<p><code>javascript
element.addEventListener(eventType, listener, useCapture);
</code></p>

<p><code>eventType</code>: click, mouseover, mouseout, etc.,</p>

<p><code>listener</code>: event handler function, it will be called when the element triggered eventType event.</p>

<p><code>useCapture</code>: you should always pass false to make it compatible with IE. This relates to event
phases which I will make another blog post about.</p>

<p>We can apply as:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;a href="#" id="mylink"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></p>

<p>```javascript
//javascript, run only on Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari
// can not run on IE
var linkEl = document.getElementById(&lsquo;myLink&rsquo;);
linkEl.addEventListener(&lsquo;click&rsquo;, function() {</p>

<pre><code>alert(arguments[0]); //event object
alert(this); //linkEl
</code></pre>

<p>}, false);
event object is passed as parameter and this refers to linkEl in event handler:</p>

<p>linkEl.addEventListener(&lsquo;click&rsquo;, function(evt) {</p>

<pre><code>doSomething.call(this, evt);
</code></pre>

<p>}, false);
```</p>

<p>By using this approach, you can add as many listeners as possible. When an eventType triggered, all
registered listeners will be executed. Note that W3C DOM specification does not require that the
first listener registered will be executed first, these listeners can be executed by random. And
till now, there is no way to check how many listeners registered in an element.</p>

<p><em>How about removing an event listener?</em></p>

<p><code>javascript
element.removeEventListener(eventType, listener, useCapture);
</code></p>

<p>I rarely use <code>removeEventListener</code>. You can not remove an anonymous function. From the above code,
I use anonymous function as listener, as the result, I can not find the way to remove it. Assigning
it a name and the problem solved:</p>

<p><code>javascript
var myListener = function() {
  alert(arguments[0]);
  alert(this);
 //first run and then remove listener, no event triggered from now anymore
  this.removeEventListener('click', myListener, false);
}
linkEl.addEventListener('click', myListener, false);
</code></p>

<p>This is the W3C way and M$ follows an other way.</p>

<p><strong>4. Microsoft Event Registration Model</strong></p>

<p>IE does not use <code>addEventListener</code> but <code>attachEvent</code>:</p>

<p>```javascript</p>

<pre><code>element.attachEvent(onEventType, handler);
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><code>javascript
var linkEl = document.getElementById('myLink');
//run on IE only
linkEl.attachEvent('onclick', function() {
  alert(arguments[0]); //event object
  alert(this); //linkEl
})
</code></p>

<p>Wanna remove a handler (listener)? Use <code>detachEvent</code>:</p>

<p><code>javascript
var myListener = function(evt) {
  alert(evt);
  alert(this);
  this.detachEvent('onclick', myListener);
}
</code></p>

<p>Note that IE does not have 2 event phases (capture and bubble) but bubble phase only. So when using
W3C, you should always use <code>false</code> for <code>useCapture</code> for safety purpose :d. If you fully understand
these 2 event phases, you can pass true for <code>useCapture</code> but intentionally.</p>

<p><strong>5. At last, combine these 2 models for simple and compatible api:</strong></p>

<p><code>javascript
//api design
addEventListener(element, eventType, listener, useCapture);
removeEventListener(element, eventType, listener, useCapture);
</code></p>

<p>My intention is that event object has to be passed as 1st parameter to listener and this has to
refer to the element in the block code. Here we come the solution:</p>

<p>```javascript
/<em>*
 * Cross browser add event listener method. For &lsquo;evt&rsquo; pass a string value with the leading &ldquo;on&rdquo; omitted
 * e.g. addEventListener(window,&lsquo;load&rsquo;,myFunctionNameWithoutParenthesis,false);
 * @param    obj object to attach event
 * @param    evt event name: click, mouseover, focus, blur&hellip;
 * @param    func    function name
 * @param    useCapture    true or false; if false => use bubbling
 * @static
 * @see        <a href="http://phrogz.net/JS/AttachEvent_js.txt">http://phrogz.net/JS/AttachEvent_js.txt</a>
 </em>/
function addEventListener(obj, evt, fnc, useCapture) {</p>

<pre><code>if (obj === null || evt === null || fnc ===  null || useCapture === null) {
   alert('all params are required for addEventListener');
    return;
}
if (!useCapture) useCapture = false;
if (obj.addEventListener){
    obj.addEventListener(evt, fnc, useCapture);
} else if (obj.attachEvent) {
    obj.attachEvent('on'+evt, function(evt) {
        fnc.call(obj, evt);
    });
} else{
    myAttachEvent(obj, evt, fnc);
    obj['on'+evt] = function() { myFireEvent(obj,evt) };
}

//The following are for browsers like NS4 or IE5Mac which don't support either
//attachEvent or addEventListener
var myAttachEvent = function(obj, evt, fnc) {
    if (!obj.myEvents) obj.myEvents={};
    if (!obj.myEvents[evt]) obj.myEvents[evt]=[];
    var evts = obj.myEvents[evt];
    evts[evts.length] = fnc;
}

var myFireEvent = function(obj, evt) {
    if (!obj || !obj.myEvents || !obj.myEvents[evt]) return;
    var evts = obj.myEvents[evt];
    for (var i=0,len=evts.length;i&lt;len;i++) evts[i]();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>/<em>*
 * removes event listener.
 * @param    obj element
 * @param    evt event name, &lsquo;click&rsquo;, &lsquo;blur&rsquo;. &lsquo;focus&rsquo;&hellip;
 * @func    function name to be removed if found
 * @static
 * //TODO make sure method cross-browsered
 </em>/
function removeEventListener(obj, evt, func, useCapture) {</p>

<pre><code>if (obj.removeEventListener) {
    obj.removeEventListener(evt, func, useCapture);
} else if (obj.detachEvent) {//IE
    obj.detachEvent('on'+evt, func);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Use this api as simple as:</p>

<p>```javascript
  var linkEl = document.getElementById(&lsquo;myLink&rsquo;);
  addEventListener(linkEl, &lsquo;click&rsquo;, function(evt) {</p>

<pre><code>doSomething.call(this, evt);
</code></pre>

<p>  }, false);
```</p>

<p>Hope that you find this post interesting, I will blog about 2 event phases soon. Happy coding :D</p>

<p>Working for Google is a very important opportunity for my future. Shannon said to me about the plan
of Google to have representative office in Vietnam soon, so if I aggree to worked with them in
Singapore in 2 years, and then I can come back to work in the representative office of Google in
Hanoi. Well, I know this is the only chance for me to work abroad and work for Google. How
interesting it is! However, if I agree to work in Singapore, it means that I have to discontinue my
study at HUT university; it means that I have to leave my family, my friends and all my good
memories behind to work there. I&rsquo;ve never been abroad, I love it.</p>

<p>Another point to mention, I&rsquo;ve just been working at eXo Platform for 1,5 months. Everything has just
started, I haven&rsquo;t done good job in eXo. I have tried much to work here. After a short period of
time, I know eXo Platform is the best place in Hanoi for my study, work and friendship. Everyone
here is very nice, we can easily get familar with each other. We share about many things: weeding,
karaokeing, departure parties. I want to know more about eXo Platform, to understand it and apply it
for my last project in Hanoi Aptech.</p>

<p>So if I aggree to work for Google in Singapore, I have to give up so many things here. If not, I&rsquo;m
still working in eXo Platform as is. Oh my God, how can I choose one? If only after some time
working for eXo Platform, would I get this kind of offer from Google? Could anyone show me the
right way :(?</p>

<p><em>Ok, thank for your visiting and replying :&ndash;). Currently, I&rsquo;m rather busy with my job at eXo
Platform: being trained + learning. Hope that I will have more time to continue with my application
+ more application in the future. I&rsquo;m working with eXo Social &ndash; an enterprise social network
supporting Open Social. There are many ways to get in touch ;&ndash;).</em></p>

<p><em>First of all, congratulations for the opportinity &ndash; even though I don&rsquo;t know you, getting an offer
from Google is a rather rare thing in the IT sector.</em></p>

<p><em>However the reason I&rsquo;m writing is because recently I started developing OpenSocial as in Hungary
the biggest social networking site implemented OS support 1 month ago. I would be interested in your
award winning application. I would be happy if I could get in touch with you.</em></p>

<p><em>Cheers,</em></p>

<p><em>Hi Hoat,</em></p>

<p><em>Although I only came to know about you or your site from the SE OpenSocial and Twitter, I think
you&rsquo;re a special individual and the oppurtunity to join Google Singapore, although being away from
Hanoi is a great chance for bigger things in the future.</em></p>

<p><em>Of course there are things to give up and other things to gain in different places, but joining
Google which has a lot of resources in terms of technologies and brand, can easily overcome the
worries you have in mind I guess?</em></p>

<p><em>And of course this is my personal opinion as I have never worked in Google before nor had I visited
their offices yet, hence it&rsquo;s just my own views.</em></p>

<p><em>However, I do wish you the very best in the choice you make. :&ndash;)</em></p>

<p><em>I think working for Google is a good opportunity and a big challenge for any developer. So, I
understand why you are wondering about it. But as you said, it&rsquo;s good for your future so why don&rsquo;t
you try to do?</em></p>

<p><em>Completes your studying is the best way I think but you can not negotiate with Google about start
working time, I think you can suspend your studying for 1 or 2 years as Bill Gate did. Maybe you can
not make a company as Microsoft, but no one knows whether you will create a Google Viet Nam in
future!</em></p>

<p><em>You should think more what you lost, what you get if you work for Google and for Exo Platform. As
you said, Exo is a good company in Ha Noi, but with my experiences, 1,5 months can not say anything.
And are you sure that you understand everything about the one? Is it really good place as your
feeling?</em></p>

<p><em>You are having a big opportunity! I wish you will have good decision!</em></p>

<p><em>Hoatle, You need all your courages to work for Google. I think it&rsquo;s truly a challenge for anyone</em></p>

<p><em>I think you shoud leave eXo and going to Singapo. Because in eXo you will not study nothing.</em></p>

<p><em>Hi Hoat</em></p>

<p><em>You are very young so there are a lot of chances is waitting and coming to you in the future.
Google is really a great opportunity, but you should have considered and choosed what is the best
practice actually. I have known that: youth always have a lot of dreams, ambitious &hellip;. and would
like to meet some new chanllenges, new chances. Beside that, you also have known exo platform
company is very good in Ha Noi where you are having the happiness time, good working eviroment,
chances for developing and becaming your carreer in here &hellip; You are the last student year in
University that means you have been farming tree and now its time to pick fruit, although the first
fruit not sweet, luscious ones but that is you have done after working, studying so hard. So, why do
not you continue to work in exo platform where you have been sowing seeds and it has been germing,
so why do not you wait to harvest. I also wondering if exo platform has good environment same your
opninon, why don&rsquo;t you try to disscuss with Officer Manager about integrated your applications for
Music to EXO Product such as eXo Social or eXo Portal and they will be able to completely help you
to develop, improve your product and in the future you can become a Product Manager EXO Social
Music&hellip; I think: that is great chance and its possible.</em></p>

<p><em>For Google, I think that this is only a &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; because there will be many changes and happened
in 2 years &hellip; Whether you can work completely in 2 years with them and then whether they have
established VPĐD in Vietnam or not? This is a completely question and strategy because of the
biggest competitor of Google is Yahoo has done to establish Yahoo Vietnam Company in Viet nam.</em></p>

<p><em>There is only my opinion. Of course the final decision is depend you. There are a lot of chances,
but its important for us how can get and find favorable environment to develop and implement
opportunities became true and success is very few. Please consider carefully and I wish the best
wish for you in the future</em></p>

<p><em>Thank a lot</em></p>

<p><em>I bet you&rsquo;ll take the offer :D</em></p>

<p><em>Departures are indispensable events in your life, especially when you have such a great opportunity
like that. You can preserve your study at HUT by signing a form, go working for Google Singapore for
one and half a year and get back and finish what you&rsquo;ve done.</em></p>

<p><em>Singapore is not that far from Vietnam, now it takes you only 2 hrs to transfer between 2 nations.
In addition, Vietnam working-environment is absolutely not as good as foreign ones for such talent
guys like you.</em></p>

<p><em>What you have to do: Get ready, set, and go. Don&rsquo;t hesitate at such interferences like that.</em></p>

<p><em>Good luck.</em></p>

<p><em>Well, thanks very much for your advice. I know, how can I miss such a great chance like this ;)</em></p>

<p>— Anh Hùng (2009-04-01 23:13):</p>

<p><em>Hello Hoạt,</em></p>

<p><em>Firstly, let me congratulate on your getting this great opportunity from Google. You are the only
Vietnamse &ndash; born, raised, and educated in Vietnam- I know who gets such an offer. :&ndash;)</em></p>

<p><em>As I&rsquo;ve tweeted you, the best thing you should do, IMHO, is to reserve your study results at HUT
and come to work for Google for 1 year (don&rsquo;t tell Google this though). If it fits you, then
decide.</em></p>

<p><em>For eXo Platform, while it is a great start, I think the sheer scale of Google will open you to new
horizons and possessing a good understanding of how the biggest technology firm operates will be of
huge benefits to you in the future.</em></p>

<p><em>My mentor passed Google&rsquo;s 8 rounds of interview to become its Product Manager in SEA. It was a
great opportunity but since Google is not doing anything great in Vietnam, he declined the offer a
few months ago. However, Google Singapore is nice company with nice people, and this is something
you should not miss.</em></p>

<p><em>Part of the reason he quit was because he had already had a great business in Vietnam, a great
family to take care of. You&rsquo;re different. Right? :&ndash;)</em></p>

<p><em>Anyways, good luck!</em></p>
